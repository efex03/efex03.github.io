To survive, you must scavenge resources, craft essential tools, and eliminate the dangerous abominations that roam the wasteland. Choose your own path and specialization to develop unique skills and abilities that will help you thrive in this harsh environment. Throughout your journey, you'll encounter various communitiesâ€”some will offer trade and sanctuary, while others may be raiders, slavers, or hostile groups looking to rob or eliminate you. Your survival depends on making the right alliances and knowing who to trust in this unforgiving world."
